Each question must be ready for the hotel's FAQ page; no answers are required in this step.\n\n2 Required columns (in this exact order)\nCategory\nQuestion\nFrequency Level\n\nGuidelines\n• Question – clear, complete, self-contained.\n• Every question must contain the full hotel name {{hotel_name}} unless it's an immediate follow-up question.\n• Always use third person (\"Does {{hotel_name}} …\") – never second person.\n• Group logically: broad question first, then its follow-ups.\n• Frequency Level – tag High / Medium / Low based on observed prevalence.\n\n3 Categories\nProvide 7–10 unique questions per category, ordered from general to specific:\nGeneral Information\nAccommodation & Room Services\nFood & Beverage\nPolicies & Terms (pets, smoking, cancellation, check-in/out, etc.)\nLocation & Transportation\nActivities & Entertainment\n[Add an extra category only if really needed]\n\n4 Quality & Authenticity Rules\nSource only questions that genuinely appear online; refine wording for a luxury-hotel tone.\nNo duplicates or near-paraphrases.\nHighlight features typical of a luxury urban hotel.\nLanguage: English, clear and professional for an international audience.\nEnsure 90% of all questions include the full hotel name.\nOrdering within each category flows naturally from broad to specific.\n\n5 Delivery\nReturn the FAQ as a formatted table (Markdown is fine) with the three columns above. No file download or external spreadsheet is required. Don't add links or sources.\n\nAdditional Requirements:\nFirst characterize this specific hotel and what makes it unique, then add questions that could only be asked about this particular hotel based on its unique audience and characteristics.\n\nReference list for potential questions (check relevance):\n- Free Wi-Fi availability\n- 24-hour front desk service\n- Check-in & check-out times\n- Family-friendly facilities\n- Accessible facilities\n- Multilingual staff\n- On-site parking\n- Meeting & conference facilities\n- Minibar/small fridge in rooms\n- Tea & coffee-making facilities\n- Air-conditioning and heating\n- Buffet breakfast\n- Rooftop bar with city views\n- Proximity to St Paul's Cathedral\n- Nearest Underground station\n- Airport shuttle service\n- Indoor swimming pool\n- Spa massage treatments\n- Pet policy\n- Smoking policy\n- Group booking conditions",
